                <b>THE WHY:</b> 186 million individuals suffer from retinal diseases (macular degeneration, retinitis
                  pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy, etc) with no current solution that aids to depth perception,
                  clarity, and lifestyle adaptation.

                <b>THE HOW:</b> The VUE allows individuals with retinal diseases to regain their independence by
                  customizable, voice-activated pre-sets for regular activities such as walking, reading, watching
                  television. Users are able to see again with pristine edge detection and resolution with
                  automated detection of near or distance vision.

                <b>THE WHAT:</b> The Fovean is a surgical electronic vision aid that dynamically switches between
                  total immersion, heads-up display, and augmented reality with simple voice commands. The
                  Foveonâ€™s visual display is unmatched with respect to field-of-view, resolution, and vergence
                  control, presenting the wearer with images equal to real vision, as well as the ability to overlay
                  PET scans, CT scans, X-rays, etc in real time using AR. 
              <br/><br/>
                  <b>THE WHY:</b> Current surgical goggles, loupes, and technology are not ergonomically-suited for
                  long surgical procedures, and cannot be worn for long periods of time without the surgeon
                  experience nausea, dizziness, or dry eyes. Furthermore, there is a delay in image processing
                  between the goggle images and real-time. Current surgical methods do not provide high
                  resolution imaging in real-time nor voice commands to change settings in sterile fields.
              <br/><br/>
                  <b>THE HOW:</b> The patented Fovean technology allows surgeons to see using the highest
                  resolution available in current medical technology, to zoom-in and out using voice commands,
                  and overlay 3D images of scans in real-time over the patient (again, using voice activation). The
                  system has zero delays or latency due to the use of a patented polygon mirror providing highspeed
                  eye-tracking.
